# Jconfig
use Java reflection to read a config file and update the object without the need to creating a match for every new variable.
this is a project with an example. 
the base idea is using the convention of naming setters with "setVarName" so we can use that to guess in an informed manner what is a variable setting function name and invoke it. 
the Config class is the magic class and the ExampleObject.java and the Main.java are used to do an example of how it works.  
in addition, there is ExampleObject.txt which is a prop file example. 
to run this in Intelij you need to just open project and copy this files.
