# Jconfig
use Java reflection to read a config file and update the object without the need to creating a match for every new variable.
this is project with exmple. 
the base idea is using the convention of naming setters with "setVarName" so we can use that to 
guess in an informed manner what is a varilable setting function name and invoke it. 
the Config class is the megic class and the ExampleObjec.java and the Main.java are used to do an exmlpe how it works.  
in addition there is ExampleObjec.txt wich is a prop file exmple. 
to run this in Intelij you need to just open project and copy this files.
